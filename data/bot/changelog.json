Previously, the bot was built on top of a third-party library, however o7 has outgrown this framework and the rebuild will allow for more features with less work overall. This means faster development and more features faster for you! \n \nOne of the new features enabled by this change is the **Auto Voice Channel** module which is a great tool to help reduce the clutter of too many voice channels in your communities! Check it out with the `!voice create` command on your server!\n\n *note: use of this command requires the user to have the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission, and o7 will need the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission in any category in which you wish to use the auto vhoice channels*\n"
