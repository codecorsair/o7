# o7 Discord bot
A discord bot for the Eve Echoes community!

## Overview
o7 is a hosted bot that is available free for anyone to add to their server. Just [click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=753820564665270333&scope=bot&permissions=3072) to invite **o7** to your Discord server.

You are welcome to self-host **o7**, however I can not fully support self-hosted installations. I will try and answer any questions on the official Discord, but I am not available for 24/7 bot support.

## Setup
1. Install docker & docker-compose
2. Edit environment variables docker-compose.yml
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Invite bot to server `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<application id>&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

## Contributing
Great! You'd like to add a feature to **o7**? I am happy to accept contributions via pull request. 

However, I do ask that you test any changes on a self-hosted bot. If you are planning to contribute I can help get your test bot set up on the official Discord with it's own channel for testing feature changes.

Instructions for setting up the bot for self-hosting can be found on our official Discord.
